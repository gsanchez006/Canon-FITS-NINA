<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN>  Binning or Histogramming Specification</A>
</H1>

<P>
The optional binning specifier is enclosed in square brackets and can
be distinguished from a general row filter specification by the fact
that it begins with the keyword 'bin'  not immediately followed by an
equals sign.  When binning is specified, a temporary N-dimensional FITS
primary array is created by computing the histogram of the values in
the specified columns of a FITS table extension.  After the histogram
is computed the input FITS file containing the table is then closed and
the temporary FITS primary array is opened and passed to the
application program.  Thus, the application program never sees the
original FITS table and only sees the image in the new temporary file
(which has no additional extensions).  Obviously, the application
program must be expecting to open a FITS image and not a FITS table in
this case.

<P>
The data type of the FITS histogram image may be specified by appending
'b' (for 8-bit byte), 'i' (for 16-bit integers), 'j' (for 32-bit
integer), 'r' (for 32-bit floating points), or 'd' (for 64-bit double
precision floating point)  to the 'bin' keyword (e.g. '[binr X]'
creates a real floating point image).  If the data type is not
explicitly specified then a 32-bit integer image will be created by
default, unless the weighting option is also specified in which case
the image will have a 32-bit floating point data type by default.

<P>
The histogram image may have from 1 to 4 dimensions (axes), depending
on the number of columns that are specified.  The general form of the
binning specification is:

<P>
<PRE>
 [bin{bijrd}  Xcol=min:max:binsize, Ycol= ..., Zcol=..., Tcol=...; weight]
</PRE>
in which up to 4 columns, each corresponding to an axis of the image,
are listed. The column names are case insensitive, and the column
number may be given instead of the name, preceded by a pound sign
(e.g., [bin #4=1:512]).  If the column name is not specified, then
CFITSIO will first try to use the 'preferred column' as specified by
the CPREF keyword if it exists (e.g., 'CPREF = 'DETX,DETY'), otherwise
column names 'X', 'Y', 'Z', and 'T' will be assumed for each of the 4
axes, respectively.  In cases where the column name could be confused
with an arithmetic expression, enclose the column name in parentheses to
force the name to be interpreted literally.

<P>
In addition to binning by a FITS column, any arbitrary calculator
expression may be specified as well.  Usage of this form would appear
as:

<P>
<PRE>
 [bin  Xcol(arbitrary expression)=min:max:binsize, ... ]
</PRE>

<P>
The column name must still be specified, and is used to label
coordinate axes of the resulting image.  The expression appears
immediately after the name, enclosed in parentheses.  The expression
may use any combination of columns, keywords, functions and constants
and allowed by the CFITSIO calculator.

<P>
The column name (and optional expression) may be followed by an equals
sign and then the lower and upper range of the histogram, and the size
of the histogram bins, separated by colons.  Spaces are allowed before
and after the equals sign but not within the 'min:max:binsize' string.
The min, max and binsize values may be integer or floating point
numbers, or they may be the names of keywords in the header of the
table.  If the latter, then the value of that keyword is substituted
into the expression.

<P>
Default values for the min, max and binsize quantities will be
used if not explicitly given in the binning expression as shown
in these examples:

<P>
<PRE>
    [bin x = :512:2]  - use default minimum value
    [bin x = 1::2]    - use default maximum value
    [bin x = 1:512]   - use default bin size
    [bin x = 1:]      - use default maximum value and bin size
    [bin x = :512]    - use default minimum value and bin size
    [bin x = 2]       - use default minimum and maximum values
    [bin x]           - use default minimum, maximum and bin size
    [bin 4]           - default 2-D image, bin size = 4 in both axes
    [bin]             - default 2-D image
</PRE>
CFITSIO  will use the value of the TLMINn, TLMAXn, and TDBINn keywords,
if they exist, for the default min, max, and binsize, respectively.  If
they do not exist then CFITSIO will use the actual minimum and maximum
values in the column for the histogram min and max values.  The default
binsize will be set to 1, or (max - min) / 10., whichever is smaller,
so that the histogram will have at least 10 bins along each axis.

<P>
Please note that if explicit min and max values (or TLMINn/TLMAXn keywords)
are not present, then CFITSIO must check every value of the binned quantity
in advance to determine the binning limits.  This is especially relevant 
for binning expressions, which must be evaluated multiple times to determine
the limits of the expression.  Thus, it is always advisable to specify 
min and max limits where possible.

<P>
A shortcut notation is allowed if all the columns/axes have the same
binning specification.  In this case all the column names may be listed
within parentheses, followed by the (single) binning specification, as
in:

<P>
<PRE>
    [bin (X,Y)=1:512:2]
    [bin (X,Y) = 5]
</PRE>

<P>
The optional weighting factor is the last item in the binning
specifier and, if present, is separated from the list of columns by a
semi-colon.  As the histogram is accumulated, this weight is used to
incremented the value of the appropriated bin in the histogram.  If
the weighting factor is not specified, then the default weight = 1 is
assumed.  The weighting factor may be a constant integer or floating
point number, or the name of a keyword containing the weighting value.
The weighting factor may also be the name of a table column in which
case the value in that column, on a row by row basis, will be used.
It may also be an expression, enclosed in parenthesis, in which case
the weighting value will be evaluated for each binned row and applied
accordingly.

<P>
In some cases, the column or keyword may give the reciprocal of the
actual weight value that is needed.  In this case, precede the weight
keyword or column name by a slash '/' to tell CFITSIO to use the
reciprocal of the value when constructing the histogram.  An expression,
enclosed in parentheses, may also appear after the slash, to
indicate the reciprocal value of the expression.

<P>
For complex or commonly used histograms, one can also place its
description into a text file and import it into the binning
specification using the syntax [bin @filename.txt].  The file's
contents can extend over multiple lines, although it must still
conform to the no-spaces rule for the min:max:binsize syntax and each
axis specification must still be comma-separated.  Any lines in the
external text file that begin with 2 slash characters ('//') will be
ignored and may be used to add comments into the file.

<P>
Examples:

<P>
<PRE>
    [bini detx, dety]                - 2-D, 16-bit integer histogram
                                       of DETX and DETY columns, using
                                       default values for the histogram
                                       range and binsize

    [bin (detx, dety)=16; /exposure] - 2-D, 32-bit real histogram of DETX
                                       and DETY columns with a bin size = 16
                                       in both axes. The histogram values
                                       are divided by the EXPOSURE keyword
                                       value.

    [bin time=TSTART:TSTOP:0.1]      - 1-D lightcurve, range determined by
                                       the TSTART and TSTOP keywords,
                                       with 0.1 unit size bins.

    [bin pha, time=8000.:8100.:0.1]  - 2-D image using default binning
                                       of the PHA column for the X axis,
                                       and 1000 bins in the range
                                       8000. to 8100. for the Y axis.

    [bin pha, gti_num(gtifind())=1:2:1] - a 2-D image, where PHA is the
                                       X axis and the Y axis is an expression
                                       which evaluates to the GTI number, 
                                       as determined using the
                                       GTIFIND() function.

    [bin time=0:4000:2000, HR( (LC2/LC1).lt.1.5 ? 1 : 2 )=1:2:1] - a 2-D
                                       histogram which determines the number
                                       of samples in two time bins between 0 and
                                       4000 and separating hardness ratio, 
                                       evaluated as (LC2/LC1), between less than
                                       1.5 or greater than 1.5.  The ?: 
                                       conditional function is used to decide
                                       less (or greater) than 1.5 and assign
                                       HR bin 1 or 2.

    [bin @binFilter.txt]             - Use the contents of the text file
                                       binFilter.txt for the binning
                                       specifications.
