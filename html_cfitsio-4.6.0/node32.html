</H1>

<P>
CFITSIO places very few restrictions on the size of FITS files that it
reads or writes.  There are a few limits, however, that may affect
some extreme cases:

<P>
1.  The maximum number of FITS files that may be simultaneously opened by
CFITSIO is set by NMAXFILES, as defined in fitsio2.h.  The current default
value is 1000, but this may be increased if necessary. Note that CFITSIO
allocates NIOBUF * 2880 bytes of I/O buffer space for each file that is
opened.  The default value of NIOBUF is 40 (defined in fitsio.h), so this
amounts to  more than 115K of memory  for each opened file (or 115 MB for
1000 opened files).  Note that the underlying  operating system, may have a
lower limit on the number of files that can be opened simultaneously.

<P>
2.  It used to be common for computer systems to only support disk files up
to 2**31 bytes = 2.1 GB in size, but most systems now support larger files.
CFITSIO can optionally read and write these so-called 'large files' that
are greater than 2.1 GB on
platforms where they are supported, but this
usually requires that special compiler option flags be specified to turn
on this  option.  On linux and solaris systems the compiler flags are
'-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE' and  `-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64'. These flags
may also work on other platforms but this has not been tested.  Starting
with version 3.0 of CFITSIO, the default Makefile that is distributed
with CFITSIO will include these 2 compiler flags when building on Solaris
and Linux PC systems.   Users on other platforms will need to add these
compiler flags manually if they want to support large files.  In most
cases it appears that it is not necessary to include these compiler
flags when compiling application code that call the CFITSIO library
routines.

<P>
When CFITSIO is built with large file support (e.g., on Solaris and
Linux PC system by default) then it can read and write FITS data files
on disk that have any of these conditions:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>FITS files larger than 2.1 GB in size
</LI>
<LI>FITS images containing greater than 2.1 G pixels
</LI>
<LI>FITS images that have one dimension with more than 2.1 G pixels
(as given by one of the NAXISn keyword)
</LI>
<LI>FITS tables containing more than 2.1E09 rows (given by the NAXIS2 keyword),
or with rows that are more than 2.1 GB wide (given by the NAXIS1 keyword)
</LI>
<LI>FITS binary tables with a variable-length array heap that is larger
than 2.1 GB (given by the PCOUNT keyword)
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The current maximum FITS file size supported by  CFITSIO
is about 6 terabytes (containing
2**31 FITS blocks, each 2880 bytes in size). Currently, support for large
files in CFITSIO has been tested on the Linux, Solaris, and IBM AIX
operating systems.

<P>
Note that when writing application programs that are intended to support
large files it is important to use 64-bit integer variables
to store quantities such as the dimensions of images, or the number of
rows in a table.  These programs must also call the special versions
of some of the CFITSIO routines that have been adapted to
support 64-bit integers.  The names of these routines end in
'll' ('el' 'el') to distinguish them from the 32-bit integer
version (e.g.,  fits_get_num_rowsll).
