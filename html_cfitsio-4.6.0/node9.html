<P>
The CFITSIO library is built on Unix systems by typing:

<P>
<PRE>
 &gt;  ./configure [--prefix=/target/installation/path] [--enable-reentrant]
                [--enable-sse2] [--enable-ssse3]
 &gt;  make          (or  'make shared')
 &gt;  make install  (this step is optional)
</PRE>
at the operating system prompt.  The configure command customizes the
Makefile for the particular system, then the `make' command compiles the
source files and builds the library.  Type `./configure' and not simply
`configure' to ensure that the configure script in the current directory
is run and not some other system-wide configure script.  The optional
'prefix' argument to configure gives the path to the directory where
the CFITSIO library and include files should be installed via the later
'make install' command. For example,

<P>
<PRE>
   &gt; ./configure --prefix=/usr1/local
</PRE>
will cause the 'make install' command to copy the CFITSIO libcfitsio file
to /usr1/local/lib and the necessary include files to /usr1/local/include
(assuming of course that the  process has permission to write to these
directories).

<P>
All the available configure options can be seen by entering the command

<P>
<PRE>
   &gt; ./configure --help
</PRE>
Some of the more useful options are described below:

<P>
The -enable-reentrant option will attempt to configure CFITSIO
so that it can be used in multi-threaded programs.  See the
"Using CFITSIO in Multi-threaded Environments" section, below, for more details.

<P>
The -enable-sse2 and -enable-ssse3 options will cause configure to
attempt to build CFITSIO using faster byte-swapping algorithms.
See the "Optimizing Programs" chapter of this manual for
more information about these options.

<P>
The -with-gsiftp-flavour and -with-gsiftp options enable support for the Globus
Toolkit gsiftp protocal.  See the "Extended File Name Syntax" chapter for more
information.

<P>
The -with-bzip2 option enables support for reading FITS files that have been
externally compressed by the bzip2 algorithm.  This requires that the CFITSIO
library, and all applications program that use CFITSIO, to be linked to include
the libbz2 library.

<P>
The 'make shared' option builds a shared or dynamic version of the
CFITSIO library.  When using the shared library the executable code is
not copied into your program at link time and instead the program
locates the necessary library code at run time, normally through
LD_LIBRARY_PATH or some other method. The advantages of using a shared
library are:

<P>
<PRE>
   1.  Less disk space if you build more than 1 program
   2.  Less memory if more than one copy of a program using the shared
       library is running at the same time since the system is smart
       enough to share copies of the shared library at run time.
   3.  Possibly easier maintenance since a new version of the shared
       library can be installed without relinking all the software
       that uses it (as long as the subroutine names and calling
       sequences remain unchanged).
   4.  No run-time penalty.
</PRE>
The disadvantages are:

<P>
<PRE>
   1. More hassle at runtime.  You have to either build the programs
      specially or have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set right.
   2. There may be a slight start up penalty, depending on where you are
      reading the shared library and the program from and if your CPU is
      either really slow or really heavily loaded.
</PRE>

<P>
On Mac OS X platforms the 'make shared' command works like on other
UNIX platforms, but a .dylib file will be created instead of .so.  If
installed in a nonstandard location, add its location to the
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable so that the library can be found
at run time.

<P>
On HP/UX systems, the environment variable CFLAGS should be set
to -Ae before running configure to enable "extended ANSI" features.

<P>
By default, a set of Fortran-callable wrapper routines are
also built and included in the CFITSIO library.  If these wrapper
routines are not needed (i.e., the CFITSIO library will not
be linked to any Fortran applications which call FITSIO subroutines)
then they may be omitted from the build by typing 'make all-nofitsio'
instead of simply typing 'make'.  This will reduce the size
of the CFITSIO library slightly.

<P>
It may not be possible to statically link programs that use CFITSIO on
some platforms (namely, on Solaris 2.6) due to the network drivers
(which provide FTP and HTTP access to FITS files).  It is possible to
make both a dynamic and a static version of the CFITSIO library, but
network file access will not be possible using the static version.

<P>
